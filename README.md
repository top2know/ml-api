This is my homework for Python Advanced Course, last upd: 31-10-2021

Try it: https://top-ml-api.herokuapp.com or https://t.me/top_ml_bot

Documentation is available at https://top-ml-api.herokuapp.com/apidocs

Examples of usage are stored at `examples` folder.

Due to Heroku it can work not so good, so do not hesitate to contact me at shuriktoptusha@gmail.com if something is down :(

Short summary:
1. Models and datasets are stored using pickle. databases could be better but on the other hand it's easier to run with less dependencies
2. Models are connected to users while datasets are common for all users. This is done for simplification of usage of standard datasets.
3. However, all the requirements are met and extended with Swagger documentation for easier access to api
4. Datasets sample1 and sample2 are pre-created for easier usage of api as you do not need to create you own dataset to try api
